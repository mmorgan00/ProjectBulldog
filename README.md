# Project Bulldog

### Overview
- Project Bulldog is an in development game that intends to be a third person arena game.

- The developer, in an effort to create a handcrafted and authentic experience, has decided to not use an off the shelf engine such as Unreal5 or Unity, and instead roll their own tech
- The stack of choice will be C++, for hopefully obvious reasons, and Vulkan as the initial graphics API. 
- In an ideal world, additional proprietary graphics APIs will be added to support console platforms


### Current state
- Most of the project at current writing follows online resources, as there is lots of learning ahead.
- I have a pretty solid base from initial learning of Vulkan and a Computer Science bachelors, however industry standards on things like engine design, build processes, and even a C/C++ standard are lacking
- For those reasons, I am choosing to follow the vkguide.dev style, as some standard is better than none. 

#### Planned features
- I do not have a concrete plan on what is going to be added. 
- One of the benefits that I am hoping to get out of rolling my own tech is a relatively lightweight tech stack, and only creating what I need.
